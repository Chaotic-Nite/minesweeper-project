## Minesweeper

Inspired by the 1992 [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) is used with the board being entirely made out of a canvas and the individual cells laying on top. The cells themselves are all within a class that's looped through for the main portions of the game. 

This is a clean and more visually easy piece.
